<h2>October, 2019 <br> Portland, Ore.</h2>

Method Camp is a weekend of talks, workshops, and engaged discussions about the work we really care about. From art to activism, caretaking to code, if you’re committed to making something new, improving the world around you, or just learning something inside and out, you belong at Method Camp.

<br>

## What’s Method Camp All About?

If you really care about doing anything, you have a way of doing — a method. Method Camp is an experiment in collectively looking past what we do to talk about _how_ we do. The goal is to create a common, temporary space where we can better understand the work we care about and why we do it, through discussion and experience. 


## Conference Schedule

Method Camp is centered around a day of keynote talks and panels, with workshops and an unconference segment to make time to directly engage with the ideas at hand. 

<br>

  > **Day 1 -- Evening:** 
  > Opening party

  > **Day 2 -- Daytime:** 
  > Main event. Speakers, workshops, panels.

  > **Day 3:** 
  > Unconference slots at multiple venues in SE Portland.

<br>

Full details will be announced via the mailing list, but in the meantime we'll be building community and conversation with smaller *Methodical* events.

## Methodical #1 -- June 23rd
We kicked things off with a [fun, free evening of mini-workshops.](events/methodical-1)

## Methodical #2: Field trip to Jackrabbit Farms -- August 17th

Located near Woodland, WA, Jackrabbit Farms is in the process of becoming a center for permaculture, ceramics, and experiential learning. Ceramicist Careen Stoll will literally walk us through the 22 acres of the project to talk the nitty-gritty of building roads, planting orchards, and opening streams to local salmon. A locally foraged lunch will be served for a $5-10 donation. Join the mailing list to get updates, but feel free to [RSVP now](mailto:info@methodcamp.org).
