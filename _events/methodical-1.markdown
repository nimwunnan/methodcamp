You’re invited to Methodical \#1, the first (and free!) Method Camp event. Come on over to the newly redesigned Studio 2020 (aka Ním’s studio aka the old Research Club space) for a night of fun, thought-provoking mini-workshops and activities. They should be a good time on their own, but it’s also a way to get a taste of what the heck this whole Method Camp thing is gonna be, anyway.

_Snacks and drinks will be served! Maybe there will also be flowers!_


## **Workflow Therapy** with Ním Wunnan

This is a method developed, taught, and practiced by Ním for years that throws out every “productivity” and “project management” tool and tactic except the ones the directly address how work becomes *stress*. Participants will go through a short list of questions together, and we’ll leave with some practical ideas and suggestions for how to change the way we do things to better fit the way we think and learn. We’ll revisit and compare notes at Method Camp in August to see how it worked out in practice.

## **Antonymic Exchange** an Anti-Algorithm for Artisanal Algorists. Created by Carl Diehl and Lindsey French

The [Antonymic Exchange](https://isea2015.org/proceeding/submissions/ISEA2015_submission_175.pdf) “is an artist-run operating system, an idiosyncratic means of developing “algorithmic literacy.” The exchange consists of a pair of artists regularly swapping messages that consist of a single, unlabeled image, meant to be the antonym of the last image to be exchanged. Diehl will discuss the history of the project, and anyone who wants to participate can pair off to start exchanges of their own. The results will be displayed and revisited at Method Camp in August

## **Conceptual Labor**  an introduction to the theory with Ním Wunnan

Method Camp is based on the tenets of the [Theory of Conceptual Labor](http://conceptuallabor.com/). Ním will present a basic introduction to the theory and talk a little about how it relates to Method Camp and its predecessor, Research Club.

## **How to Have Hope in 2019**  A Rebecca Solnit reading group

As the internet constantly reminds us, Things Right Now are, to sum it up, a bit fucked. Rebecca Solnit’s *Hope in the Dark* offers a more actionable, thoughtful take on the fucked-ness of things, so let’s read it together. This is a very low-impact reading group --- we’ll introduce the book at Methodical, and we’ll have until Method Camp proper to finish the book, at which point we’ll discuss our thoughts and feels in a followup session.

## **Personal Expertise Lightning Round** with everyone who wants in

Everyone’s an expert in something, and often other people don’t even know that something exists. This will be a roundtable session where anyone and everyone who has a hidden skill or well of obscure knowledge will get the floor for five minutes to shed light on their hidden expertise.
