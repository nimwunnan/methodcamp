Join us for a tour of this magical, muddy wonderland. Owner and ceramicist Careen Stoll will literally walk us through the 22 acres of the project to talk the nitty-gritty of building roads, planting orchards, and opening streams to local salmon. A locally foraged lunch by Faye Holliday will be served for $10.

For those who would like to carpool, we will meet at Colonel Summers Park in SE Portland at 11 am. We will leave the park by 11:15 at the latest, carpooling to Jackrabbit Farms in Woodland, WA. Directions will be provided before departing. Email [info@methodcamp.org](mailto:info@methodcamp.org?subject=Carpooling) if you plan on driving separately. 

We will convene at Jackrabbit Farms around noon, where the owners will give a presentation and take us on a walking tour of the property. Lunch will be served at 2pm, with time for conversation and questions afterwards. We will leave by 5pm to return to Portland around 6. 


As Jackrabbit Farms is still under construction, please prepare for mud, rough terrain, and thick, occasionally brambly vegetation. Most of the location is ***not ADA accessible***, but if you have suitable transportation, you can participate in the presentation, lunch, and conversation from the parking area at Jackrabbit.

This event is organized by Method Camp. Please email [info@methodcamp.org](mailto:info@methodcamp.org?subject=Jackrabbit Questions) directly if you have any questions.
