Ceramicist Careen Stoll will literally walk us through the 22 acres of the project to talk the nitty-gritty of building roads, planting orchards, and opening streams to local salmon. A locally foraged lunch by Faye Holiday will be served for a $10 donation. Stay tuned for more details, but feel free to RSVP now. We have room for 30-40 people.
