_If you really care about doing anything, you have a way of doing — a method._ Method Camp is an experiment in collectively looking past what we do to talk about _how_ we do. 

We create common, temporary spaces where we can better understand the work we care about through discussion and experience.

[The Theory of Conceptual Labor](http://conceptuallabor.com/){:target="blank"} is the foundation for how we're talking and thinking about work.


## Who's Running This

Mainly me, [Ním Wunnan](http://wunnan.com){:target="blank"}

I used to run [The Portland Research Club](/history), and Method Camp is its spiritual successor.
