<h2>August 16-18, 2019 <br> Portland, Ore.</h2>

Method Camp is a weekend of talks, workshops, and engaged discussions about the work we really care about. From art to activism, caretaking to code, if you’re committed to making something new, improving the world around you, or just learning something inside and out, you belong at Method Camp.

## What’s Method Camp All About?

If you really care about doing anything, you have a way of doing — a method. Method Camp is an experiment in collectively looking past what we do to talk about _how_ we do. The goal is to create a common, temporary space where we can better understand the work we care about and why we do it, through discussion and experience. 


## Conference Schedule

Method Camp is centered around a day of keynote talks and panels, with workshops and an unconference segment to make time to directly engage with the ideas at hand. 

<br>

  > **Friday, August 16 -- Evening:** 
  > Opening party

  > **Saturday, August 17 -- Daytime:** 
  > Main event. Speakers, workshops, panels.

  > **Saturday, August 17 -- Evening:** 
  > Camp out in Woodland, Washington, dinner served.

  > **Sunday, August 18 -- Daytime:** 
  > Unconference slots at multiple venues in SE Portland.






## Actual camping

The highlight will be an overnight on the land owned and worked by one of the featured speakers. Located near Woodland, WA, Jackrabbit Farms is in the process of becoming a center for permaculture and experiential learning. Limited spaces are available for a camp-out featuring a locally-foraged dinner where we can review what we learned over a bonfire under the stars.
