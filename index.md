Method Camp hosts [intimate events](/events/jackrabbit-farms-tour) that illuminate the nitty-gritty work behind interesting projects in and around Portland, OR. 


These include fun, [thought-provoking workshops](/events/methodical-1) to help you engage directly with how you work.

We're building a community conversation about work, culminating in a weekend conference in the summer of 2020.
