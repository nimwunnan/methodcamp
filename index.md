**If you really care about doing anything, you have a way of doing â€” a method.** Method Camp is an experiment in collectively looking past what we do to talk about _how_ we do. The goal is to create common, temporary spaces where we can better understand the work we care about and why we do it, through discussion and experience.

For the 2019 season, Method Camp is hosting **intimate events**  that illuminate the nitty-gritty work behind interesting projects and facilitating **fun, thought-provoking workshops** to help you engage directly with your ideas about how you work.

These small events will lay the groundwork for a **weekend conference** in Portland, Oregon in the summer of 2020. Until then, you can follow the conversation on our mailing list and at our events.
