**What’s different between how an outsider thinks of what you do and what you *really* do?**


When a layperson thinks of your job title, or the category of work that you do, what do you think they assume about it? Do you have any pet peeves about talking about your work to people at parties --- biases or misconceptions you often have to fight to describe what you actually do?

<br>

**How do you personally describe your work to yourself?**


Given your answer to the previous question, what do you think of when you think of your work? What tasks first come to mind? How do you get into the zone? How do *you* see it?

<br>

**What is something about your work that is hard to do even if you have the instructions?**


Basketball is easy --- just score more points than the other team. What are similarly “easy” explanations of your work, and how do they unravel when you try to do them?

<br>

**What really matters to the work that you do?**


What has your experience taught you about how to approach the work that you do? Are there things that you thought were important when you began that have fallen by the wayside? Have you discovered crucial ideas, habits, or tools that you never would have known about at the start?

<br>

**What, deep down, is the nature of your work?**


If you were to remove all the non-essential trappings of your work and strip it down to the bare necessities that define the work, what are those things? 

<br>


**Why, deep down, do you do this work?**


There are so many things to do --- how did you end up doing this work? And why do you stay with it?

<br>

**Further questions**


What are the terms of the art of doing what you do?

What analogies do you rely on?

What contextual messages do you look for?

What is immeasurable but very important in your work?
